1 It's such a warm place,
2 But there on the street,
3 Where our footprints are waited for,
4 Stardusted boots
5 Sparkle and shine.
6 Here are the shepherds and upholstered chair,
7 The trigger untouched
8 When it was the right time.
9 Dazzling dreams below the bright sun, orb,
10 My blood type mark is on the sleeve,
11 There's my ordinal number marked on the sleeve,
12 Wish me now some luck in the fight,
13 Sayin' now, sayin'!
14 I won't stay in this field of green,
15 I won't stay in this field of green,
16 Wish me now to be lucky,
17 Sayin' now, sayin'!
18 ... Be lucky!
19 I am able to pay, but I never want
20 A triumph at any price,
21 I never want
22 Someone's chest lying under my foot.
23 I would rather stay here with you,
24 Just to stay here with you,
25 But the star which is high in the skies
26 Still gives me the route.
